Spent the first afternoon getting to grips with the basics of NextJS from Vercel. 

Here are my initial reactions:

- good documentation and resources
- easy integration with GitHub to develop deployment pipelines
- commercial product which will want to 'upsell'

As for the project, the features that I like and I think would make the framework suitable for our application are: 

- Dynamic URLs through the 'Link' component
- Global and component level styling - Styled JSX
- Supports server-side rendering for our custom CMS (likely to be the Ecologi WordPress)
- getStaticProps method for server-side rendering
