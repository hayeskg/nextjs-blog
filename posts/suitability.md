The idea to use NextJS was floated by Alex Price, CTO at Ecologi. He is helping with mentoring in exchange for my help developing a site for the conference. 

The features that I like and I think would make the framework suitable for our application are: 

- Dynamic URLs through the 'Link' component
- Global and component level styling - Styled JSX
- Supports server-side rendering for our custom CMS (likely to be the Ecologi WordPress)
- getStaticProps method for server-side rendering
